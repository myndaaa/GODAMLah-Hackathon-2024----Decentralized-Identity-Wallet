## **Introduction**
In an increasingly digital world, secure identity verification is crucial. From accessing online banking to government services, users are constantly required to prove their identity. Unfortunately, current systems often fail to provide robust security, leading to data breaches, identity theft, and loss of trust. Our project aims to tackle these challenges by creating a **Decentralized Identity Wallet** that leverages blockchain and biometric encryption to provide a secure, private, and user-controlled solution for digital identity management.

## **Problem Statement**
Current identity verification systems face significant challenges:
- **Data Breaches**: Centralized databases are frequent targets for hackers, risking mass identity theft and financial losses.
- **Identity Theft**: Unauthorized access to sensitive information leads to fraud and misuse.
- **Inconvenient Authentication**: Passwords are difficult to manage and prone to error, causing frustration and insecurity.
- **Lack of Privacy Control**: Users have little control over how their data is stored, shared, or used, leading to privacy violations.

These issues erode user trust and make current systems inadequate for today’s digital landscape.

## **Solution**
Our **Decentralized Identity Wallet with Biometric Encryption** solves these problems by:
1. **Decentralized Data Storage**: Storing identity credentials locally on user devices, with only cryptographic proofs recorded on a blockchain, eliminating centralized database vulnerabilities.
2. **Biometric Security**: Using encrypted biometrics (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition) for authentication, ensuring data never leaves the device.
3. **User-Controlled Data Sharing**: Empowering users to grant and revoke access to their credentials through blockchain-enabled smart contracts.
4. **Seamless Cross-Platform Verification**: Allowing users to authenticate securely across multiple platforms using a single wallet.
5. **Fraud Prevention**: Leveraging blockchain’s immutability to make identity-related transactions tamper-proof and fraud-resistant.
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensuring privacy-by-design principles align with global regulations like GDPR and PDPA.

By combining **blockchain technology**, **biometrics**, and **homomorphic encryption**, our solution creates a safer, more private, and user-friendly system for managing digital identities.
